## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass variables, mixins and functions
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### *Sass*

I learned about the fundamentals of Sass, how to use sass variables, and the basic usage of mixins and functions as well as how powerful such functionalities are. It was a really thrilling experience to see how practical it becomes to write css through Sass!

### *Dynamic background*

Creating a dynamic background wasn't as complex as I though it could be. Since I've done [something similar](https://amodeusr.github.io/EP02-SPAmodeusR/) before it helped me a little, however, differently from the quoted case, in this website I applied the background in a way it would change the website's appearance depending on the platform it's visualized, through a dynamic background which resizes itself accordingly to the user's screen.
